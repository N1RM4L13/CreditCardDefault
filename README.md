# Credit Card Default Prediction

## Problem Statement
This project aims to develop a classification model to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment in the next month. Accurate predictions will enable the bank to estimate cash inflows, manage financial risk, and optimize budget planning. By analyzing historical payment data, the model will identify high-risk customers, helping the bank to minimize losses and strategize effectively.

## Use Case
The classification model will help the bank in the following ways:
1. **Cash Flow Optimization**: Predict repayment inflows to allocate resources efficiently.  
2. **Risk Assessment**: Identify high-risk customers to mitigate financial losses.  
3. **Strategic Budgeting**: Align financial strategies with repayment predictions for effective planning.
